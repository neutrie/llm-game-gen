# llm-game-gen


## Description

This proof-of-concept project is a text-based game with the content generated by
LLM.

In the game, the player moves between connected rooms and collects items. The
objective is to collect a specific item. The player performs these actions by
interactively writing a series of commands.

The game data is stored in a JSON file containing an array of rooms. Before the
game starts, the user selects which game data to load - either by selecting an
existing JSON file or generating a new one using the LLM.
